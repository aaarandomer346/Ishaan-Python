# int is a deciaml number, like 1, 2, 3
# float is a number with a decimal palce, like 1.2, 2.3, 3.4
    # division always returns a float, and multiplication with floats always returns a float
# boolean, can either be false or true, is a result from if() statments
# strings, characters, words, sentences, can be either put in double or single quotes("" or '')
    # in any code, refer string as str, its better trust
    # \ can be used as an escape character, like normally, print('jame's') doesnt work, so you do print('jame\'s')

print(type(1))
print(type(1.2))
print(3 == 3)
print(3 == 5)
print(bool(7)) # any number above 0 will output True
print(bool(3 == 5)) # can also be used like this
print("string double")
print('string single')
print(type("string"))

# print('jame's') gives error
print('jame\'s') # no error
